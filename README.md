# IbuprofenUI: Explore the pharmacokinetics of Ibuprofen in preterm newborns

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/IbuprofenUI](https://shinyappstore.com/a/IbuprofenUI)__

IbuprofenUI is an application designed for simulating Population Pharmacokinetics (popPK) scenarios of Ibuprofen enantiomers in preterm newborn infants. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug commonly used for pain relief and inflammation. The pharmacokinetics of Ibuprofen involve the study of its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion in the body. In the context of this application, IbuprofenUI allows users to explore various scenarios by manipulating key parameters and observing their impact on the pharmacokinetic profile of Ibuprofen. The drug Ibuprofen consists of two enantiomers, R- and S-ibuprofen, which exhibit differences in their activity. The application is built upon an original analysis of clinical study samples involving preterm newborn infants who received three successive administrations of Ibuprofen. Reference: Gregoire N et al. Journal of clinical pharmacology. 2008;48(12):1460-8.
